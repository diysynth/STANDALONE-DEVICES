# LIL' MONO SYNTH

The Lil' Mono Synth is a very simple east coast style analog synthesizer. It is quite limited compared to commercial synths but it is a fun little device that sounds dirty and quite lofi.
It contains a sawtooth wave VCO that tracks V/Oct, a square wave sub-oscillator, a simple and dirty sounding resonant VCF, a "VCA" and an attack/release envelope generator
that can modulate the amplitude and the filter cut-off frequency.
The VCO doesn't track very precise but okay-ish pitch tracking with +/-5 cents of tracking error can be expected over a span of 4 to 5 octaves. The IC that is used for the VCO is obsolete as through hole part
but can be substituted with a SOP IC and an adapter board (see the modwiggler post). The through hole ICs are still widely available at ebay and also amazon. Only NXP/PHILIPS HEF4046 ICs track well!
